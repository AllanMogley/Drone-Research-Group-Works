# Drone-Research-Group-Works
A Repository for Drone Research Group Operations and Processes

This Program uses the SGP4(Simplified General Pertubations 4) model
to predict a satellite's position based on the TLE(Two line element data)
      

# How to Use
1. Fork the repository to your local machine
2. Install the libraries in the requirements.txt
3. Open the SGP4.py file within the Project SpaceTrack folder and Run

You can add you satellite's TLE data in the TLE.py file and change your locational info. within the SGP4 file

### The Auto_update has an auto-update feature for the overpass dates but it's still work in progress
